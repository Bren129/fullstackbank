# MIT Project: full-stack bad bank application

This is my final capstone project of MITxPro. This application was created in React Redux, while using Node and Express to establish a connection and interact with a MongoDB database using Mongoose.


## Installation

Download the starter files or clone this git repository.

Run the following command in both the root file and the "client-side" file.

```bash
  npm install 
```
    
## To run the application you'll need to follow these steps:

In a terminal run the command
```javascript
mongo
```
then enter the root file of the application in a separate terminal, navigate to the "server-side" folder and run the following command:

```javascript
node server.js
```

finally in a third separate terminal, from the root file navigate to the "client-side" folder and run the command:

```javascript
npm start
```
